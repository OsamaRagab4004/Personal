        <p><strong>Description : </strong>This is the first training project on PHP, an online store to display products, add and delete products, classify products into categories, and then pay via PayPal, but I used PayPal for developers and learned how to deal with payment systems. .</p>


        <p><span>Hint: Unfortunately, the project is not available online because the files are not organized properly in order to be uploaded to the server and it is difficult to modify them because this will require a lot of time, so you can download and run it on a local server or simply watch the following video, which reviews all the details</span></p>
