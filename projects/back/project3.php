        <p><strong>Description : </strong>This project was very interesting, as I understood all the details of registration in any site and how to activate the email, later in Laravel, I discovered that within seconds a complete and well-protected registration system can be made, through a ready-made design provided by Laravel, but also it is very good to understand all Something about the details even when you don't have to write the code from the beginning.</p>


        <p><span>Hint: During my application on PHP in this project, I read some articles and searched for books on security and I read one of the books that talk about how to secure the website and the type of cyber-attacks that exist, so I have a good idea that is not professional, but it is good and scalable during practical experience</span></p>
