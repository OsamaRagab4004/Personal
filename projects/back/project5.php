        <p><strong>Description : </strong>This is a paid project for a Saudi company, I communicated with the client and understood what he wanted and then translated it into a software project, then presented it again to the client before implementation and adding modifications, then the implementation was done. The project is not complicated but it was very nice to deal with the client, understand what he wants, implement it and get a good impression from the client after the work is done. Unfortunately, I can't show the source code but I can provide an English translated version of the site so you can try it out..</p>
