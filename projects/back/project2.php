        <p><strong>Description : </strong>This Project was about Web Scrabing, or web data extraction , data scraping used for extracting data from websites. I would like to know how  google works, or websites for flight trips or in general any website that can take another information from another website and show it, so it was a great project, i learned about something called crawling, and new informations that maybe i use it one day in any project.</p>

        <p><span>Hint: in this example, i did web scraping for BBC, and it can be another website, just change the link in crawl.php</span></p>
