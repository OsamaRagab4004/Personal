        <p><strong>Description : </strong>This Project was a strong practise to write php in OOP style, and to understand, how to create relations between tables in Database, which i discovered later its much easier in laravel, but i prefer to learn everything and basics before using a framework like laravel. with laravel its very easy to make a website like that, but with pure php, it was not easy, but fun.</p>

        <p><span>Hint:
            you can log in with one of thies accounts, because there is no search engine to add friends, so i did it for you, if you want to search for a user, write the name in the link of website like this :  </span></p>
            <p><span>Password for all accounts is:  12345 </span></p>

         <p><strong>user1@gmail.com</strong> *This user has no friends but 3 friend requests, so you can try to accept friend requests, and see posts of friends.</p> 

         <p><strong>user2@gmail.com</strong> This user have friends and can see their posts.</p>
